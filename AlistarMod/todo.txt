Kit Idea:
- Primary is 3 hit where if you hit all 3 you get the ult effect for some duration
- Right mouse is the ground slam which knocks up and slows/stuns all enemies around him
- Shift is the headbutt which dashes him in a direction and knocks back any enemies he hit
- R is the trample where he gets a stack each time he hits during it and if he gets a certain number of stacks it empowers his
	next attack or something. This one could use some thought
- Passive is just healing based on enemy deaths

Fetatures to add:
- Passive
- Skins
- Voicelines/cutsom sfx
- Possibly make 3rd hit of melee combo do more damage though this may be overkill with the armor buff
- Custom jump animation

Polish to add:
- Entrance is something more suitable than drop pod
- Shield indicator around him when Unbreakable Will armor buff active
- Look into improving trample effect indicator
- Potential to add more suitable custom crosshair
- death animation

Stuff for next ship
- Find way for him to deal with flying enemies easier, wandering vagrant is brutal for him
- Add Alistar color theme on menu
- Fix buffs not working for non host players, look at henrymod roll for this
- Clean up codebase more, remove all henry stuff
- Look into refining primary, it moveing you forward can feel jarring and works too well in the air
- Look into way to mitigate fall damage for him
