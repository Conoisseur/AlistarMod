*Always a mighty warrior with a fearsome reputation,
Alistar seeks revenge for the death of his clan at the hands of the Noxian empire.
Though he was enslaved and forced into the life of a gladiator,
his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly becoming a beast.
Now, free of the chains of his former masters,
he fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged,
his rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.*

**Alistar is a melee-bruiser survivor with lots of crowd control but little range.
He excels at sending hordes of enemies flying but is susceptible to aerial foes and 
those who he can't close in on.**

## Known Issues (To Fix)
- If you're not hosting the game you won't receive the attack and movement speed buffs from Trample or the armor buff from Unbreakable Will
- If you headbutt directly down you take fall damage

## TODO
Features that will probably be added at some point:
- Passive
- Skins
- Voicelines/cutsom sfx
- Custom jump animation

Potential Polish I might look into:
- Using something other than drop pod for stage entrance
- Shield indicator around him when Unbreakable Will armor buff active
- Add ability indicators, so you can see where your abilities are hitting
- Add a more suitable crosshair if one exists
- Add death animation
