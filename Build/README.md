*Always a mighty warrior with a fearsome reputation,
Alistar seeks revenge for the death of his clan at the hands of the Noxian empire.
Though he was enslaved and forced into the life of a gladiator,
his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly becoming a beast.
Now, free of the chains of his former masters,
he fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged,
his rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.*

**Alistar is a melee-bruiser survivor with lots of crowd control but little range.
He excels at sending hordes of enemies flying but is susceptible to aerial foes and 
those who he can't close in on.**

## Known Issues (To Fix)
- Various Networking/Multiplayer issues (UNTIL THESE ARE FIXED I DON'T RECOMMEND PLAYING HIM IN MULTIPLAYER. Ideally this would be patched before release but I have less time to work on this than I had before and want to get it out now)
  - Other players can't see Alistar's ability animations
  - Only the game host can do damage using Alistar's abilities; other players using can't deal damage using his abilities
  - Some of his abilities can be used to hit and knockback allies (might leave this partly in as it's pretty funny to headbutt another player)
- If you headbutt directly down you take fall damage

## TODO
Priority List
- Remove all unecessary code/cleanup codebase
- Fix networking/playing with other Alistars
- Clean up this README and add the Github link

Features that will probably be added at some point:
- Passive
- Skins
- Voicelines/cutsom sfx
- Custom jump animation

Potential Polish I might look into:
- Using something other than drop pod for stage entrance
- Shield indicator around him when Unbreakable Will armor buff active
- Add ability indicators, so you can see where your abilities are hitting
- Add a more suitable crosshair if one exists
- Add death animation
